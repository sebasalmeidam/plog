**Thought for 1 user**

## To Do:

* Redesign so that each user can create/see their one categories/activities
* Time calculation
* Each Project should have its own activities (create relation)
* Home/ActivityList -> Activity Time message: not display minutes if not started or has a record
* pending font roboto from framework -> load font by google fonts
* fix new category design
* create a model for activity description (has many relationship) instead of / separator
